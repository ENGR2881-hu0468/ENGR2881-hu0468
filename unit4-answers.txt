# Question 'ab': Write not more than 250 words about 'cryptographic hash functions and vulnerabilities (eg MD5 and successors)'
BEGIN:ab
A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function used in cryptography.
A cryptographic hash function takes a message as input and produces a message digest using a hash function
vulnerabilities for cryptographic hash function such as MD5 may have collisions and sometimes output length greater than the fixed length

# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'assymetric encryption'
BEGIN:ac
Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption that uses two separates yet mathematically related keys to encrypt and decrypt data
Asymmetric encryption is a way for you to verify third parties that you’ve never met via public channels that are insecure
